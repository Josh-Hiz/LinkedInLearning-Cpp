# Linkedin Learning Path: Becoming a C++ Developer 
## Linkedin Learning Course 1: Learning C++
### A collection of exercises and note-like C++ programs that I made while going through this course
- To see the main project of this course, please go to exercise *05_01*, as I programmed a text based Student Records system in C++, it's features include:
1. The ability to write to a text file the grade, student, and courses that student is taking such that it acts like a report card
2. The GPA of that student
3. A secondary system to add towards the Student Records vectors (Courses, Students, Grades)
- Note: Many of the functions used pointers in order to ensure efficiency in the code
## Linkedin Learning Course 2: C++ Essential Training
### A collection of exercises and note-like C++ programs that I made while going through this course
- To see the main project of this course, please go to exercise *FinalChallenge*, as I programmed a text based playing card deck system in C++ using classes and encapsulation with the STL, it's features include:
1. The ability to ask someone how many decks they want to create and when each deck is created they are automatically shuffled so no 2 decks are the same!
2. *dealHand* function that deals hands to a maximum of 4 players (The new hands are printed in console a maximum of 4 times)
3. Displays the initial amount of cards in the deck and after each hand is dealt the remaining cards. Ex: You deal a hand of 10 cards out of a total of 3 randomly made decks, each deck has pack of 52 cards therefore 156 cards total, after the hand is dealt, it is now 146 cards with the possibility of duplicates because you have 3 decks to choose from.
- Note: The final project is a *DECK SYSTEM*, the actual challenge did not require making a game however it can be scaled up to that point using the current code, all that would be needed is some extra game functions, winning condition, etc etc, anyways, enjoy.
## Linkedin Learning Course 3: Templates& the STL
### A collection of notes and excercise files provided by the instructor 
- This course did not have a formal challenge or final project like the previous 2 courses, rather this was purely for note-taking and an extremely valuable reference to using C++ templates and its capabilities, as well as algorithms, using functors, lambda syntax, and learning how to apply STL algorithms
## Linkedin Learning Course 4: C++ Webservers and API's
Due to the nature of the course being developing webservers, all webserver projects and files are in a private repository for my own reference. The course gave me valuable first-time experience using Docker, Heroku, and building a REST api in C++. It used the Crow micro-webframe work, but due to its extremely outdated nature I would not recommend crow for production or professional use, rather use  Drogon, an extremely efficient web framework that literally is the fastest web framework on the planet as of 2022
## Linkedin Learning Course 5: Functional programming in C++
### A collection of notes and challenges
- All challenge files were simple in nature and can be found in the challenge folders of each chapter. This course is extremely short and provided me with good reference material on using functional programming techniques in C++, that, even though unorthodox, can be handy and are very interesting to use.
