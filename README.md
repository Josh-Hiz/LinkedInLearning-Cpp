# Linkedin Learning Path: Becoming a C++ Developer 
## Linkedin Learning Course 1: Learning C++
### A collection of exercises and note-like C++ programs that I made while going through this course
- To see the main project of this course, please go to exercise *05_01*, as I programmed a text based Student Records system in C++, it's features include:
1. The ability to write to a text file the grade, student, and courses that student is taking such that it acts like a report card
2. The GPA of that student
3. A secondary system to add towards the Student Records vectors (Courses, Students, Grades)
- Note: Many of the functions used pointers in order to ensure efficiency in the code
## Linkedin Learning Course 2: C++ Essential Training
### A collection of exercises and note-like C++ programs that I made while going through this course
- To see the main project of this course, please go to exercise *FinalChallenge*, as I programmed a text based playing card deck system in C++ using classes and encapsulation with the STL, it's features include:
1. The ability to ask someone how many decks they want to create and when each deck is created they are automatically shuffled so no 2 decks are the same!
2. *dealHand* function that deals hands to a maximum of 4 players (The new hands are printed in console a maximum of 4 times)
3. Displays the initial amount of cards in the deck and after each hand is dealt the remaining cards. Ex: You deal a hand of 10 cards out of a total of 3 randomly made decks, each deck has pack of 52 cards therefore 156 cards total, after the hand is delt, it is now 146 cards with the possibility of duplicates because you have 3 decks to choose from.
- Note: The final project is a *DECK SYSTEM*, the actual challenge did not require making a game however it can be scaled up to that point using the current code, all that would be needed is some extra game functions, winning condition, etc etc, anyways, enjoy.
