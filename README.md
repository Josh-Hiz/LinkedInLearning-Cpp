# Linkedin Learning Path: Becoming a C++ Developer 
## Linkedin Learning Course 1: Learning C++
### A collection of exercises and note-like C++ programs that I made while going through this course
- To see the main project of this course, please go to exercise *05_01*, as I programmed a text based Student Records system in C++, it's the features include:
1. The ability to write to a text file the grade, student, and courses that student is taking such that it acts like a report card
2. The GPA of that student
3. A secondary system to add towards the Student Records vectors (Courses, Students, Grades)
- Note: Many of the functions used pointers in order to ensure efficiency in the code
